You’ve reached the personal website of Teofil Nakov — a biologist working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Alverson lab at the University of Arkansas.

I study various aspects of diatom evolution using laboratory experiments, phylogenetics, and genomics. Diatom taxonomy, especially in ancient lakes, was a focus early on in my studies. In graduate school I tested hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships among species the evolution of adaptive phenotypes. As a postdoc I am learning how diatoms acclimate to changes in salinity at the level of genes and their transcripts. This work will help us understand how they colonized and diversified in freshwater, but also how they might respond to future environmental change in the oceans. Diatoms are fascinating in many respects and learning about their ecology, evolution, and diversification is my continuing interest.
