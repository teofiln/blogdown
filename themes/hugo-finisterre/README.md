# Finisterre Theme for Hugo

This theme was adapted from the [Hugo Finite](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-finite/)
theme by [Marcus Brinkmann](https://lambdafu.net),
adding some structure and sylistic touches from
[Rob J. Hyndman's](https://robjhyndman.com) and
[Kieran Healy's](https://kieranhealy.org) web sites.

The Hugo Finite theme was inspired by [Greg Restall's](http://consequently.org)
and [Kieran Healy's](https://kieranhealy.org) web sites
and also by the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) for Hugo.

For the Finisterre theme,
I have added support for automatically generating publication lists
from BibTeX files (requires python and pandoc)

Contributions welcome!
