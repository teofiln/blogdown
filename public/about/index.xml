      <description>You’ve reached the personal website of Teofil Nakov. I am a biologist working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Alverson lab at the University of Arkansas.
I study various aspects of diatom evolution using laboratory experiments, phylogenetics, and genomics. Diatom taxonomy, especially in ancient lakes, was a focus early on in my studies. In graduate school I tested hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships among species the evolution of adaptive phenotypes. As a postdoc I am learning how diatoms acclimate to changes in salinity at the level of genes and their transcripts.</description>
