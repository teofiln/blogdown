      <description>One of the checks if the SNPs called in an analysis are sound, is to take a look at the ratio of transitions to transversions (T_i/T_v). If mutations were random, we expect to see a T_i/T_v of 0.5, because there are twice as many types of transversions as there are transitions. But, of course, transitions (purine-to-purine or pirimidine-to-pirimidine) and transversions (between purines and pirimidines) are not equally likely—transitions are much more common than transitions.</description>

      <description>You’ve reached the personal website of Teofil Nakov — a biologist working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Alverson lab at the University of Arkansas.
I study various aspects of diatom evolution using laboratory experiments, phylogenetics, and genomics. Diatom taxonomy, especially in ancient lakes, was a focus early on in my studies. In graduate school I tested hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships among species the evolution of adaptive phenotypes. As a postdoc I am learning how diatoms acclimate to changes in salinity at the level of genes and their transcripts.</description>
