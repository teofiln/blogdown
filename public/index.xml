      <title>R function to calculate transitions/transversion ratio of SNPs from a VCF file</title>

      <description>One of the checks if the SNPs called in an analysis are sound, is to take a look at the ratio of transitions to transversions (T_i/T_v). If mutations were random, we expect to see a T_i/T_v of 0.5, because there are twice as many types of transversions as there are transitions. But, of course, transitions (purine-to-purine or pirimidine-to-pirimidine) and transversions (between purines and pirimidines) are not equally likely—transitions are much more common than transitions.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

      <description>You’ve reached the personal website of Teofil Nakov — a biologist working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Alverson lab at the University of Arkansas.
I study various aspects of diatom evolution using laboratory experiments, phylogenetics, and genomics. Diatom taxonomy, especially in ancient lakes, was a focus early on in my studies. In graduate school I tested hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships among species the evolution of adaptive phenotypes. As a postdoc I am learning how diatoms acclimate to changes in salinity at the level of genes and their transcripts.</description>
