      <description>One of the checks if the SNPs called in an analysis are sound, is to take a look at the ratio of transitions to transversions (T_i/T_v). If mutations were random, we expect to see a T_i/T_v of 0.5, because there are twice as many types of transversions as there are transitions. But, of course, transitions (purine-to-purine or pirimidine-to-pirimidine) and transversions (between purines and pirimidines) are not equally likelyâ€”transitions are much more common than transitions.</description>
